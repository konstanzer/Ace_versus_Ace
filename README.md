1. MLB Statcast.
	
	Purpose: MLB Statcast data has been collected for five years using high-speed cameras to track every pitch and play at the major league level. It may be interesting to investigate for hidden value in player performance using the new metrics.
	
	Question: Excellent predictors for MVPs and Hall of Famers already exist in the form of WAR and Bill James' Grey Ink/Black Ink. Many of my questions are subjective in nature and not suitable for a scientific analysis (e.g. what made the 1998 Yankees so dominant?) Daren Willman has made some outstanding visualizations based on this data but such results are not hypothesis-based. 
	
	Data: Baseball Savant maintains a query-able database of Statcast data. The output can de downloaded as a csv file. For traditional statistics, baseball-reference.org maintains a comprehensive database of every game dating back to the 19th century.

2. Gamestop.
	
	Purpose: Gamestop's stock bubble earlier this year pitted retail investors lead by the subreddit wallstreetbets against hedge fund managers who had shorted the stock heavily. The massive short squeeze was a national story and RObinhood's trading restrictions damaged the company's reputation.

	Question: What caused the bubble in January? There is some debate whether institutional investors were not on both sides of the trade. There is also a potentially catastrophic issue if it turns out that hedge funds counterfeited stock in order to create price momentum in the stock. While interesting, this question is too difficult to answer with public data.

	Data: Daily price movements from Yahoo Finance will show that a bubble existed. They measure how much of the stock is institutionally owned, which may be useful. Services like HFM sell expensive licenses to access hedge fund data but there will not be clear evidence of fraud in publicly available data. 

3. Whaling.
	
	Purpose: Many cetaceans (large marine mammals) are under threat of extinction from human activity. Bringing awareness to the shrinking numbers of these species may curb their depletion.

	Question: What cetaceans are in the gravest danger of extinction? What does the database tell us about the changing size of the whale populations and how successful has the IWF ban on commercial whaling been?
	
	Data: Marine biologist Daniel Purdy calls the catch data collected by the FAO (a UN organization) the best dataset we have for the "visible" haul of marine life from the ocean. (There is also a large illegal componnt for which no reliable data exists.) The IUCN maintains an informative website about endangered species and a .shapefile of the ranges of endangered whales. The IWC also maintains data on whales that can be scraped. Many documents are .pdfs. I think these can be scraped as well.
