Baseball Savant is a website that contains MLB Statcast data. This data includes data about each pitch such as speed, spin, and location. Most importantly, this source has information about the batted ball such as exit velocity and launch angle.

The website offers robust querying options. However, for predictive modeling/machine learning purposes, it is useful to have an observation for each pitch. The website currently does not offer this functionality. The goal of this project is to provide as complete a database of pitch events as possible. There are other projects that focus on specific queries or the functions can be easily modified to select different subsets of the data. This script allows for simple loading of a portable database or the creation of individual files that could be loaded to a storage object like S3 on AWS.
