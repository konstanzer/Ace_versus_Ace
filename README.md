### 1. MLB Statcast.
-----
* Purpose: MLB Statcast data has been collected for the last five years using high-speed cameras tracking every pitch and play at the major league level. It may be interesting to investigate for hidden value in player performance using the new metrics similar to what Billy Beane did with OBP and the Pirates with defensive shifts.
	
* Question: WAR is a new metric that has become widely accepted as a measure of player value. Strangely, it has a complicated formula that no one seems to know. I wonder what statcast and traditional statistics correlate best with a high WAR. With this data, I have to avoid asking very subjective questions, such as, 'Why was team or player X so good?' which cannot be answered definitively.
	
* Data: Baseball Savant maintains a query-able database of Statcast data. Query outputs can be downloaded as a .csv file. The site owner is Daren Willman, a stat-geek who has made some outstanding visualizations based on this data. For traditional statistics to accompany the new ones, baseball-reference.org maintains a comprehensive database dating back to the 19th century.

3. Whaling.
-----
* Purpose: Many cetaceans (large marine mammals) are under threat of extinction from human activity. Bringing awareness to the shrinking numbers of these species may curb their depletion.

* Question: What cetaceans are in the gravest danger of extinction? How successful has the IWF ban on commercial whaling been?
	
* Data: Marine biologist Daniel Purdy calls the [catch data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-production/en) the best dataset we have for the "visible" haul of marine life from the ocean. Unfortunately, there exists a large illegal component for which no reliable data exists. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources [maintains a redlist of endangered species](https://www.iucnredlist.org/) and a .shapefile with geographic ranges of endangered whales. The International Whaling Commission also [maintains data on whales](https://iwc.int/estimate) that can be scraped from the website. Many documents are .pdfs and these can be scraped as well.
