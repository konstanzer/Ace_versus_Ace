1. MLB Statcast.
	
	Purpose: MLB Statcast data has been collected for the last five years using high-speed cameras tracking every pitch and play at the major league level. It may be interesting to investigate for hidden value in player performance using the new metrics similar to what Billy Beane did with OBP and the Pirates with defensive shifts.
	
	Question: WAR is a new metric that has become widely accepted as a measure of player value. Strangely, it has a complicated formula that no one seems to know. I wonder what statcast and traditional statistics correlate best with a high WAR. With this data, I have to avoid asking very subjective questions, such as, 'Why was team or player X so good?' which cannot be answered definitively.
	
	Data: Baseball Savant maintains a query-able database of Statcast data. Query outputs can be downloaded as a .csv file. The site owner is Daren Willman, a stat-geek who has made some outstanding visualizations based on this data. For traditional statistics to accompany the new ones, baseball-reference.org maintains a comprehensive database dating back to the 19th century. 

2. Gamestop.
	
	Purpose: Gamestop's stock bubble earlier this year pitted retail investors lead by my favorite subreddit wallstreetbets against hedge fund managers who had shorted the stock heavily. The massive short squeeze was a national story. Trading platform Robinhood placed subsequent trading restrictions, which damaged the company's reputation.

	Question: What caused the bubble in January? There is some debate whether institutional investors were not on both sides of the trade. There is also a potentially catastrophic issue if it turns out that hedge funds counterfeited stock to fabricate price momentum. While interesting, this question is almost assuredly too difficult to answer with public data.

	Data: Daily price movements from Yahoo Finance will show that a bubble existed. They measure how much of the stock is institutionally owned, which may be useful. Services like HFM sell expensive licenses to access hedge fund data but there will not be evidence of fraud in publicly available data. 

3. Whaling.
	
	Purpose: Many cetaceans (large marine mammals) are under threat of extinction from human activity. Bringing awareness to the shrinking numbers of these species may curb their depletion.

	Question: What cetaceans are in the gravest danger of extinction? What does the database tell us about the changing whale populations? How successful has the IWF ban on commercial whaling been?
	
	Data: Marine biologist Daniel Purdy calls the catch data collected by the FAO (a UN organization) the best dataset we have for the "visible" haul of marine life from the ocean. Unfortunately, there exists a large illegal component for which no reliable data exists. The IUCN maintains an informative website about endangered species and a .shapefile with geographic ranges of endangered whales. The IWC also maintains data on whales that can be scraped from the website. Many documents are .pdfs. I think these can be scraped as well.
